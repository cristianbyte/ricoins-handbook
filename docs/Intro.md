### API Usability Documentation for Riwi

#### Introduction
Welcome to the API Usability Documentation for Riwi! This comprehensive guide is crafted to empower the frontend team at Riwi in effectively utilizing the gamification API. 

In this initial version, our primary goal is to provide clear and concise instructions to facilitate seamless interaction with the API. Please note that security measures are not yet implemented in this version, allowing for unrestricted access to aid in development and testing.

#### Roles
Before diving into the endpoints and their functionalities, it's essential to understand the roles within the Riwi ecosystem. The API caters to three distinct roles:

1. **ADMIN**: This role holds full control over the system, enabling the management of users and their respective roles.
2. **TEAM LEADER**: Acting as instructors, Team Leaders oversee and supervise the developers' progress and activities.
3. **DEVELOPER**: Developers, the users in training, have access to their data and can track their progress within the system.

#### Endpoints Overview
Our documentation is structured into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the API:

1. Clans: Explore the endpoints related to grouping users into cohorts or courses.
2. Users: Understand how to manage user-related operations, such as retrieval and modification.
3. Scores: Learn about endpoints related to tracking and managing user scores.
4. Modules: Dive into the endpoints responsible for managing educational modules and content.

We aim to provide detailed explanations, examples, and usability notes for each endpoint to ensure a smooth and efficient development process.

Let's embark on this journey of exploring and leveraging the power of Riwi's gamification API!
